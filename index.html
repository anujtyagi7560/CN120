            <p>Yoga Is Self-Realization — The aim of Yoga is self-realization to fully experience or “realize” one’s
                true nature. The Waves of Mental Activity Are like Curtains Which Hide Our True Nature</p>
            <h2>Exercise & Fitness</h2>
            <p>Exercising regularly, every day if possible, is the single most important thing you can do for your
                health. In the short term, exercise helps to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. In the
                long term, it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, depression, and many
                cancers.</p>
            <h3>Two workout strategies that reduce cardiovascular disease risk</h3>
            <img src="https://domf5oio6qrcr.cloudfront.net/medialibrary/15042/8acb5578-6ac9-4b73-8a37-f3f608a97a03.jpg"
                alt="">
            <p>Doing regular aerobic exercise — the kind that works your heart and lungs — is one of the best ways to
                reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. Now, findings published online Jan. 17, 2024, by the
                European Heart Journal suggest that doing a combination of aerobics and strength training might reduce
                cardiovascular risk factors just as effectively. The study involved about 400 people (ages 35 to 70)
                classified as overweight or obese who also had high blood pressure. They were randomly assigned to one
                of four exercise programs: a 60-minute aerobic workout three times a week, a 60-minute strength training
                workout three times a week, a 60-minute combination of aerobics and strength training (30 minutes of
                each) three times a week, or no exercise at all. After one year, people in both the aerobics-only group
                and the combination exercise group (but not the strength-training-only group) had a significant
                reduction in a combined measure of cardiovascular risk factors, compared with people who didn't
                exercise. These risk factors included blood pressure, LDL (bad) cholesterol, blood sugar, and body fat.
                People doing the combined workouts also improved their muscle strength. What this means: it might be
                equally healthful to replace half of your aerobic workout with strength training, without adding
                additional exercise time.</p>
            <h3>An easier way to do high-intensity interval training</h3>
            <img src="https://domf5oio6qrcr.cloudfront.net/medialibrary/15048/c7aeb8db-de4d-45f6-88c0-edd90a7c5fbe.jpg"
                alt="">
            <p>By now, you're probably familiar with high-intensity interval training (HIIT), a popular workout strategy
                that alternates bursts of strenuous exercise with rest or lower-intensity activity. The technique helps
                you get fit faster than a traditional moderate-intensity workout. HIIT also produces equal or greater
                improvements in blood pressure, blood sugar, weight loss, and functional ability (such as walking
                quickly or getting out of a chair), compared with moderate-intensity exercise.

                But what if you have an old sports injury, a chronic disease, or a sedentary lifestyle that makes HIIT
                seem too challenging? The answer might be to perform the powerhouse workout in a pool.</p>
            <h4>Aquatic HIIT</h4>
            <p>An analysis of 18 studies published online Nov. 14, 2023, by BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine found
                that people with chronic conditions who took part in high-intensity interval training in the water —
                called aquatic HIIT or AHIIT — experienced a similar boost in endurance (their maximum sustained
                physical exertion) as people who took part in land-based HIIT.

                Almost 900 people were involved in the studies. Conditions among participants included arthritis, low
                back pain, lung or heart problems, peripheral artery disease, diabetes, obesity, a history of stroke,
                and spinal cord injury.</p>
            <h2>Stepping up activity if winter slowed you down</h2>
            <img src="http://content.health.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/96cf6052-83ba-4116-88bf-767390a5a2e2.jpg"
                alt="">
            <p>If you've been cocooning due to winter's cold, who can blame you? But a lack of activity isn't good for
                body or mind during any season. And whether you're deep in the grip of winter or fortunate to be basking
                in signs of spring, today is a good day to start exercising. If you're not sure where to start — or why
                you should — we've shared tips and answers below.</p>
            <h4>Moving more: What's in it for all of us?</h4>
            <p>We're all supposed to strengthen our muscles at least twice a week and get a total at least 150 minutes
                of weekly aerobic activity (the kind that gets your heart and lungs working). But fewer than 18% of U.S.
                adults meet those weekly recommendations, according to the CDC.</p>
